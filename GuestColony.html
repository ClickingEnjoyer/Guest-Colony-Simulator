  <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
  <p> One day, you woke up to find yourself in the middle of a ship. Didn't you die in a tragic space accident that involved Guests? You thought to yourself in your head.
  As you try to get up from the floor, you find that you have no more limbs, and that you simply fly up when you think of it. Could it be? You look in a nearby window,
  and you realise to your shock and horror that you have been turned into one of the Guests you were so scared of! Now that you have realised your true nature, you begin
  to hunger for memories... </p>
